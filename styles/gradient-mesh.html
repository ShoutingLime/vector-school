    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Gradient Mesh is a vector illustration technique used to create smooth color transitions and realistic shading within vector graphics. Unlike simple linear or radial gradients, Gradient Mesh allows artists to build complex, multi-directional blends of colors, giving vector artwork a more natural and three-dimensional look.</p>

    <h2>Origins and History</h2>
    <p>The Gradient Mesh tool was introduced in Adobe Illustrator 8 (1998) and became a powerful feature for digital artists. Before its arrival, vector graphics were often flat and geometric, relying on basic gradients or solid colors. Gradient Mesh revolutionized vector illustration by enabling the creation of highly detailed, photorealistic images that were previously possible only with raster graphics.</p>

    <h2>Key Visual Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mesh grid with anchor points over an object.</li>
      <li>Color control at each node, blending smoothly.</li>
      <li>Smooth transitions and natural shading.</li>
      <li>Realism – highlights, shadows, and textures.</li>
      <li>Full scalability as vector graphics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications of Gradient Mesh</h2>
    <p>Gradient Mesh is used in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Photorealistic illustrations (fruits, portraits, objects).</li>
      <li>Product rendering for advertising and packaging.</li>
      <li>Logos and branding with soft gradients.</li>
      <li>Digital art requiring painterly effects.</li>
      <li>Stock vector graphics with high detail.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gradient Mesh vs. Other Styles</h2>
    <p>Compared to Flat Design, Gradient Mesh is far more detailed and realistic. Unlike Clay-style or 3D renders, it achieves realism entirely within vector tools, without raster textures. It requires more time and technical skill, but produces highly unique results.</p>

    </a>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gradient Mesh is one of the most advanced tools in vector illustration, bridging the gap between raster-like realism and the scalability of vector graphics. Its ability to create lifelike artwork ensures it remains a cornerstone technique for professional illustrators and designers.</p>
