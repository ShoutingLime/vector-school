    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Flat Design is a minimalist design style that emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and functionality. It avoids complex textures, gradients, and three-dimensional effects, focusing instead on clean shapes, solid colors, and clear typography.</p>

    <h2>Origins and History</h2>
    <p>Flat Design emerged in the early 2010s as a reaction to skeuomorphic design. The shift was driven by the need for more efficient and adaptable visuals in digital interfaces. Microsoft popularized the style in 2010 with its “Metro” design language, followed by Apple in 2013 with iOS 7.</p>

    <h2>Key Visual Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Minimalism – only essential elements remain.</li>
      <li>Solid colors – bright, contrasting palettes.</li>
      <li>Simple shapes – geometric forms dominate.</li>
      <li>Typography – clean sans-serif fonts.</li>
      <li>No depth – absence of shadows and gradients.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications of Flat Design</h2>
    <p>Flat Design is widely used in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User Interfaces (UI/UX)</li>
      <li>Icons and pictograms</li>
      <li>Infographics</li>
      <li>Marketing and advertising</li>
      <li>Vector illustrations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Flat Design vs. Other Styles</h2>
    <p>Compared to Skeuomorphism, Flat Design looks abstract and less realistic. Unlike Clay-style or 3D illustration, Flat Design avoids depth and tactile effects. Its closest relative is Minimalism, though Flat Design tends to be more colorful.</p>

    </a>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Flat Design transformed digital aesthetics by prioritizing clarity and efficiency. While new trends like Material Design or 3D illustration have emerged, Flat Design remains a timeless and practical approach.</p>
